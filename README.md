# StashItemToChest Mod - A SMAPI Mod for Stardew Valley
#### A mod for stardew valley: stash all items in your inventory to chest with hotkey

Modder: PhthaloBlue  

This is a simple mod that allows players to quickly stash items in their inventory into opened chest which already has those items.

###Require:  
1. [Stardew Valley](http://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/)
2. [SMAPI: +0.40.1](https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI/releases)

###Download [here](https://github.com/lambui/StardewValleyMod_StashItemsToChest/releases)

###Customize:  
Default hotkey is Tab but you can change hotkey by changing the config.json file.  
Check out KeyCode.txt file to find your desirable key code.

###Note:  
This mod is compatible with [Chest Anywhere mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/518/?).  
I made this mod because [Smartmod](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/smapi-smartmod.108104/) stops working with the newest version of Stardew Valley and SMAPI and I find the Stash function is extremely useful to pass up on.
